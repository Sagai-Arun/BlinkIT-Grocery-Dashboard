Welcome to the BlinkIT Grocery Dashboard—a dynamic Power BI project built to uncover actionable insights from grocery retail operations data. This interactive dashboard provides a clear overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to item sales, ratings, and outlet performance, designed for data-driven decision-making in the retail domain.

**🧾 Project Overview**

This Power BI dashboard visualizes performance and sales data of BlinkIT grocery outlets across various locations and store types. The project aims to identify patterns in sales behavior, customer preferences, and outlet efficiency across different clusters. The dataset includes attributes like fat content, item types, outlet sizes, and establishment years, making it perfect for exploratory retail analytics.

Total Sales: Aggregated sales across all outlets.

Average Sales per Item:
Sales average calculated per product/item.

Number of Items: Total number of distinct items sold.

Average Rating: Average product rating across categories.

**🧩 Interactive Filters**

To enhance exploratory analysis, slicers were applied to enable dynamic filtering by:

Outlet Location Type (e.g., Urban, Rural)

Outlet Size (Small, Medium, High)

Item Type (e.g., Snacks, Dairy, Frozen Foods)

**📈 Visual Elements Used**

The dashboard includes the following visualizations to illustrate data relationships and segment performance:
